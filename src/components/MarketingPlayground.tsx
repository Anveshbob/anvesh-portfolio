              Ever wondered if the format of your resume on job portals actually
              makes a difference? I did too! So, I ran a little experiment on
              Naukri, creating two identical profiles with the exact same text but
              using different resume formats:

                format.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Account B:</strong> Used my original resume format.
              </li>

                <strong>My Takeaway:</strong> It seems the resume format isn't
                just about aesthetics! The numbers suggest that Naukri's algorithm
                might indeed favor profiles using their own suggested format, even
                when the content is identical.
